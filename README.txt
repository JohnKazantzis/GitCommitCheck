A simple bash script checking if any directories have uncommited changes

Coded in Bash

How to use the script:
- Create a folder with the 2 scripts of the repositories in the same folder your other repo folder
  reside.
- Copy the gitPushAll.sh ( I'll try to improve that aspect of the script so you wont have to do this
  or I'll create that copies the script inside all your other folders so you wont have to do this 
  manually
- Run the GitCommitCheck.sh script
